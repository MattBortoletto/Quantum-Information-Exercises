## Documentation
The Ex07-MatteoBortoletto.f90 file uses four modules: 
- 'HarmonicOscillator1D' which contains the following functions/subroutines:
    - DiscretizedLapalacian: computes the discretized laplacian;
    - HarmonicPotential: computes the harmonic potential;
    - ComputeEigenvalues: computes the eigenvalues/eigenvectors using the LAPACK subroutine 'zheev';
    - ComputeProbabilityDens: computes the probability densities corresponding to one eigenfunction;
    - ComputeThEnergy: computes the theoretical eigenvalues.

- 'Utilities', which contains the following functions/subroutines:
    - str_i: converts an integer into string;
    - str_r_d: converts a real into string with decimal notation;
    - str_r_e: converts a real into string with exponential notation;
    - WriteEigenvalues: writes the computed eigenvalues in a text file;
    - WriteEigenvectors: writes the computed eigenvectors in a text file;
    - NormalizePs: normalizes the psi and check the normalization.

- 'TimeEvolution', which contains the following functions/subroutines:
    - FourierTransform: computes the Fourier transform using FFTW
    - InverseFourierTransform: computes the inverse Fourier transform using FFTW
    - psiTimeEvol: computes the time evolution of the state

- 'debugger', which contains a module with a subroutine that can be used as checkpoint for debugging. It includes a control on a logical variable 'debug' and optional variable/array/message to be printed. Furthermore, it contains a logical variable 'end_program' which can stop the program in case of need. 

The main program ('time_evolution') asks the user to enter the value of T. Then the computation proceeds automatically.
