MATRIX MULTIPLICATION PROGRAM -- DOCUMENTATION 

This program performs the matrix multiplication loop in two different orders and in addition it uses the intrinsic Fortran function
'matmul'. 

There are two modules:
- debugger. It contains a subroutine that can be used as checkpoint for debugging. It includes a control on a logical variable
  'debug' and it includes an optional message to be printed. Furthermore, it contains a variable 'end' which can stop the program 
  in case of need. 
- mult. It contains two functions:
  - mult1. It performs the matrix multiplication using a loop which is not optimized.
  - mult2. It performs the matrix multiplication usign a loop which is optimized according to the way Fortran stores matrices in 
    memory, that is as columns. 

The main program ('MyMatrixMultiplication') accepts as input the dimensions of the two matrices to multiply. Particular attention is
paid to this step, in fact:
- the dimensions must be greater or equal to 1 (allowing also vector-matrix multiplications);
- the number of columns of the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows of the second one.
If these conditions are not satisfied, the program will continue to ask to enter the dimension of the matrices. 

The matrices will be filled with random integer numbers between 0 and 10.

The user can will be asked if he wants to save the results of the computations in a text file ('results.txt), whereas the CPU 
timings will be printed in the terminal.
